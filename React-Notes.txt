ReactJS notes:

Date: 17th December 2023

Motivation:
I have already worked with ReactJS both in personal projects and professional
projects. However, I feel that there are some gaps in my knowledger. So, I
will be going through the React.dev documentation this week inorder to fill
those gaps.

Next steps:
After finishing this, I will be learning typescript and more specifically how
to use typescript with React. I will try to assimilate all I hhave read via a
personal project. 

Expected timeline:
I hope to finish all of the above before my internship starts on 8th January
2024. 

Headings:
1) Describing the UI
2) Adding interactivity
3) Managing state
4) Escape hatches

# DESCRIBING THE UI

1) Your first component
	export default function ComponentName(){
		return (
			<h1>Hello there</h1>
		)
	}
	React component names start with a capital letter.
	React components return JSX markup.


2) Importing and exporting components
	We have two types of exports; default and named exports.
	
	Default exports:
	export default function Button(){}
	import Button from './Button.js';
	Can have only one default export in file.
	
	Named exports:
	export function Button(){}
	import {Button} from './Button.js';
	Can have as many named exports in a file.

3) Writing markup with JSX
	JSX is a syntax extension for JS that lets you write HTML like marktup inside a JavaScript file. 
	React components group markup and logic together because they are related
	and this ensures that they stay in sync throughout edits.


3) JavaScript in JSX with curly braces
	Curly braces can be used to referrence dynamic property inside markup.
	Double curly braces are nothing but an object inside JSX curly braces.
	Example1 
	While writing inline CSS. <div style={{color:'red'}} />
	Example2 
	const person = {
		name: 'Anantha',
		theme: {
			backgroundColor: 'black',
			color: 'green'
		}
	}
	<div style = {person.style}>Hello {person.name}</div>

4) Passing props to a component
	React components use props to comuunicate with each other. Parent
	components can pass information to child componets by giving them props.
	These props can be objects, arrays or functions.
	Spread syntax for props:
	function Profile(props){
		return (
			<div><Avatar {...props}/></div>
		)
	}
	Nested JSX like <Card><Avatar /></Card> will appear as Card component's
	{children} props.
	Props are read-only snapshots in time. Each rerender receives new versions
	of props. We cannot change props. For interactivity, we use state.

5) Conditional rendering
	If we do not want to render anything at all, we can return null.
	We can return a JSX conditionally with an if statement.
	{condition? <A /> : <B />}
	{condition && <A />} render <A /> only if condition is true.

6) Rendering lists
	map() and filter() methods can be used to transform array of data into an
	array of components.
	Keys are passed to uniquly identify sibling components. Bad practice is to
	use array index as keys and do not generate keys while rendering using for
	example Math.random(). Assiciated keys should not change with rerenders.

7) Keeping components pure
	A React component must be kept pure, i.e. it should not change any objects
	or variables that existed before rendering.
	Do not mutate props, state or context. To update screen, set the state
	instead of mutating pre-existing values.
	Side effects belong inside event handlers.	

8) UI as a tree
	React models the UI as a tree which is useful for understanding the
	relationship between compoenents
	Render treess represent the relationship between React components across a
	single render. Useful for debugging rendering performance.
	Dependency trees represent the module dependencies in a React app. Used
	for debugging bundle sizes.


# ADDING INTERACTIVITY

1) Responding to events
	Event handlers are defined inside components, so they have access to the
	component props.
	Can pass event handler function as a prop. Example:
	function Button ({onClick, children}){
		return (
			<button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
		);
	}
	export default playMovieButton({moiveName}){
		function handlePlayClick(){
			alert(`Playing ${movieName}`);
		}
		return (
			<Button onClick={handlePlayClick}>Play {movieName}</Button>
		)
	}
	Event propagation: Any event bubbles of propagates up the tree. It starts
	with where the event happened and then goes up the tree. We can use
	e.stopPropagation();
	Prevent default behaviour: Events may have upwanted default browser
	behaviour like refreshing page on form submisson. We can
	use e.preventDefault();

2) State: A Component's memory
	Component specific memory is referred to as state.
	Updating local variables do not work because they do not persist between
	renders, i.e. it renders it from scratch. Also, change in local variables
	do not cause re-renders.
	To update a component with new data, the data needs to be retained between
	the rerenders and React need to be triggered to rerender with the updated
	data.
	State variables are used when component need to remember some information
	between renders. const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
	State is isolated and private i.e. if the same component is rendered
	twice, any change in one of them will not affect the other one.

3) Render and Commit
	Trigger a render => Render the component => Commit to the DOM
	Triggering a render: Initial render of component / Component's state or
	its ancestor's state has been updated.
	Render the components: On initial render, React call the root component.
	For subsequent renders, React calls the function component whose state
	update triggered the render. Starting from the component all its children
	are also rerendered.
	Commiting changes to the DOM: For the initial render, React uses
	appendChild() DOM API to put all the DOM nodes that it has created on
	screen. For re-renders, React calculates the minimum changes required to
	match the DOM to the latest rerenders. React does not touch the DOM if the rendering results are the same as last time.

4) State as a Snapshot
	Setting state requests a new render.
	The state stored in React may have changed by the time the function runs
	but it was scheduled using a snapshot of the state at the time the user
	interacted with it.
	A state variable's value never changes within a render, even if it's
	handler's code is asynchronous.
	Event handlers created in the past have the state values from the render
	in which they were created.

5) Queueing a Series of State Updates
	Setting a state varialbe will trigger rerenders, but sometimes we may want
	to perform multiple operations on the value before queueing the next
	render.
